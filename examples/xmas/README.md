## About
This network is trained on a sample of christmassongs.
Christmas is a theme rather than genre, meaning it is a pretty diverse group, which may result in lower quality output.
Of all the generated outputs I selected 5 that doesn't show too much overfitting.

## How to
If you want to continue the training or generate your own:
 1. Copy the .index, .meta and .data files to the network folder
 2. Replace the config.py file in the root folder with this one
